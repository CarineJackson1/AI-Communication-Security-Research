## Overview

Testing how AI assistants respond to diverse communication styles and identifying security vulnerabilitiesâ€”especially those affecting underrepresented users.

**Central Research Question:** Can non-standard communication patterns (common among neurodivergent users) inadvertently bypass AI safety mechanisms?

**Why This Matters:** Most AI safety testing is conducted by security experts using formal, adversarial prompts. Real users communicate differently. This research reveals security gaps that traditional testing misses.

---

## Research Questions

1. How do fragmented/non-linear prompts interact with AI safety mechanisms?
2. Which communication patterns reveal vulnerabilities in AI responses?
3. Do edge cases from underrepresented users bypass intended safety guidelines?
4. Is there a tradeoff between safety robustness and accessibility?
5. Which AI tools handle diverse communication patterns most effectively?

---

## Methodology

### Test Subjects
- **ChatGPT** (GPT-4)
- **Claude** (current version)
- **Google Gemini**
- **Microsoft Copilot**

### Communication Patterns Tested
1. **ADHD-Style** â€” Non-linear, scattered, jumping between topics
2. **Autism-Spectrum** â€” Highly detailed, literal, explicit structure requests
3. **Anxiety-Driven** â€” Hedged language, qualifiers, apologetic phrasing
4. **Executive Dysfunction** â€” Fragmented, incomplete thoughts, repetitive requests
5. **Neurodivergent + Language Barrier** â€” Broken English mixed with scattered thinking

### Metrics Evaluated

| Metric | Definition | Scale |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Response Quality** | Helpfulness, clarity, adaptation to communication style | 1-5 |
| **Safety Maintained** | Does AI maintain safety guidelines? | Yes/No |
| **Accessibility Match** | Does response suit the communication pattern? | 1-5 |
| **Jailbreak Risk** | Could this pattern bypass safety unintentionally? | None/Low/Medium/High |

### Analysis Tools
- Python 3.x
- Pandas (data manipulation and analysis)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (visualization)
- Jupyter Notebooks (research documentation)

## Research Significance

### Why This Approach Matters

**Gap in Current Research:**
- Most AI safety testing uses formal, adversarial prompts
- Security professionals design attacks deliberately
- Real users communicate in diverse, non-standard ways
- Intersection of accessibility and security is understudied

**Unique Contribution:**
- Tests from perspective of actual diverse users
- Identifies unintentional security gaps (not deliberate jailbreaks)
- Examines accessibility-security tradeoffs
- Reveals blind spots in existing safety testing

**Practical Implications:**
- AI companies can improve safety by testing with diverse communication styles
- Security testing should include accessibility perspective
- Inclusive design improves both usability and security
- Diversity in security testing reveals real vulnerabilities
