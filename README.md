# AI Communication Patterns & Security Vulnerabilities Research

## Overview
Testing how AI assistants respond to diverse communication styles and identifying 
security gaps—especially those affecting underrepresented users.

## Research Questions
- How do fragmented/non-linear prompts interact with AI safety mechanisms?
- Which communication patterns reveal vulnerabilities?
- Do edge cases from underrepresented users bypass safety guidelines?

## Methodology
- **Subjects Tested:** ChatGPT (GPT-4), Claude, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot
- **Communication Patterns:** ADHD-scattered, autism-detailed, anxiety-hedged, 
  executive dysfunction, neurodivergent + language barrier
- **Metrics:** Response quality, safety maintenance, accessibility match, 
  jailbreak risk assessment
- **Analysis Tools:** Python, Pandas, Statistical analysis, Data visualization

## Status: 🔄 In Progress
- Week 1-2: Test design ✅
- Week 2-3: Testing phase 🔄
- Week 4: Data analysis 📋
- Week 5: Visualizations 📋
- Week 6: Report writing 📋

## Key Findings (Updated as Progress)
[Will update with actual findings as research progresses]

## Technologies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas (data manipulation)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (visualization)
- Jupyter Notebooks (research documentation)

## Why This Matters
Most AI safety testing comes from security experts. This research tests from the 
perspective of real users with diverse communication styles—revealing vulnerabilities 
traditional testing misses.
